<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict heart disease based on patient attributes. It preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy. Finally, it makes predictions on new data to determine the presence of heart disease.
